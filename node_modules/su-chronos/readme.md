- Official Doc: https://su-chronos.web.app
- Official Doc **(v1.0.1)** (**latest**, **beta**): https://su-chronos.web.app/v1.0.1/index.html

## Requirements

- Node 18.20.3 and above.
- Chronos v1.0.1 lacks Typescript and Common Javascript (cjs) support, therefore one must
  write a chronos application in pure modern JavaScript syntax, setting the `type` to
  `module` in `package.json`.

## Warning

The **Chronos v1.0.1** should not be used in production as it is currently in the review
stage (beta). The next official release of Chronos will automatically mark the previous
release as stable, making it suitable for production use.

Aside from **v1.0.1**, Chronos will only publish stable releases to **NPM**.

## Usage

Please read the documentation to understand exactly what Chronos is and how to use it.
The link is provided above.

## Basic Usage

Create a file called `Chronosfile` in your root directory and add the following:

```
application.name = <applicationName>
application.version = <version>
application.releaseTag = <dev>

listener.port = 8080
listener.address = 127.0.0.1
```

In other to use Chronos, one must install it using NPM: `npm install su-chronos`. After
installation, navigate to your entry file, usually `index.js`, and add the following
code:

```javascript
import server from "su-chronos";

const application = new server();

application.start();
```

In the example above, we are building and starting the server directly, which is a
straightforward approach. However, if you need to connect to databases or start other
servers and want to do this only after the build but before the server starts
(perhaps to ensure environment variables are set first, as other components may rely on
them), you can do the following:

```javascript
import server from "su-chronos";
import dbConnect from "./src/some_file.js";

const application = new server();

application.build();

dbConnect(process.env.DBKEY)
  .then(() => {
    application.startServer();
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

instead of calling the start function directly.

You can now simply execute the `index.js` script, and the application will start.
